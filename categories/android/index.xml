      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson&#34;&gt;Jackson&lt;/a&gt; just made my day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I had to make some changes to one of our API. The change was minor so I have added additional fields into my JSON response. I have also kept the old fields just to make the existing clients happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During testing, I figured out that the change breaks existing clients. I was surprised! The error was,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;org.codehaus.jackson.map.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field &amp;ldquo;image&amp;rdquo; (Class Promotion), not marked as ignorable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright; I thought. Android developer must be a very strict guy and failing when the response structure has additional fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he was not doing anything explicit to make the parsing strict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like, Jackson&amp;rsquo;s by default parsing mode is strict and it fails when there are any extra fields. Stupid! I have never seen any JSON parser doing this. I have used Ruby, C#, Golang and everywhere no library will have this option turned on by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this caused additional pain and I had to introduce another version of the API. We have also configured Jackson not to do strict parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
