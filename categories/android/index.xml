      <description>Jackson just made my day!
Today, I had to make some changes to one of our API. The change was minor so I have added additional fields into my JSON response. I have also kept the old fields just to make the existing clients happy.
During testing, I figured out that the change breaks existing clients. I was surprised! The error was,
 org.codehaus.jackson.map.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field &amp;ldquo;image&amp;rdquo; (Class Promotion), not marked as ignorable</description>
