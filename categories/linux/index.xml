      <description>xargs is very powerful commandline utility. Here is what Wikipedia says about xargs
 xargs is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute command lines from standard input
 Most common use of xargs would be to do something like,
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm  Let us assume that you have a file with list of files to be downloaded from a website.</description>

      <description>Recently I have started evaluating the Pomodoro Technique which I found quite interesting. I am still evaluating the technique and not yet concluded on whether I should continue using it.
To implement pomodoro technique, you need a kitchen timer or egg timer. Since I use pomodoro for my programming work, I obviously don’t want to use a physical timer. I couldn’t find a decent timer for linux especially one that works well with Xfce.</description>
